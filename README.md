# MINI-PROJECT
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting diabetes using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset. We perform data prepocessing,exploratory data analysis(EDA),and apply machine learining models to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic features **DATASET:diabetes.csv STEPS IN THE NOTEBOOK 1.Data Upload & exploration 2.Data Preprocessing 3.Exploratory Data Analysis 4.Model Building 5.Results & Evaluation
